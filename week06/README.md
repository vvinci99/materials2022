# Week 6 - Assignment

1. Choose a transcription factor, e.g. GATA1, MYOD1, CEBPB, REST (or any of your choice that has a motif and available ChIPseq data)
2. Download the (e.g. Mouse) peaks for that factor (whatever cell type)
3. Identify the instances of the factorâ€™s motif
4. Answer the following questions:
  - Of all the peaks, what proportion contains a motif for the factor?
    (Expected form of an answer: "of the XX peaks, XX (XX%) contain a motif")
  - Of all instances of that motif in the genome, what proportion is bound by the factor (i.e. has a peak)?
    (Expected form of an answer: "of the XX motif instances, XX (XX%) overlap a peak")
