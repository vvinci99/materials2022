# Week 5

## Assignment

1. Using the peaks you downloaded last week, identify bivalent domains (H3K27me3 + H3K4me3) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC)

2. What happens to those regions upon differentiation?
 - Choose a differentiated cell type (e.g. hepatocytes, neural progenitor, or smooth muscle cells)
 - Download the H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 peaks from this cell type
 - How many of the mESC bivalent domains are, in this differentiated cell type, overlapping either mark or their combination?

Please make sure that you name your final file `assignment.html` and indicate the time you spent on it!
