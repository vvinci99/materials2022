# Week 10

## Homework

1. Plot the Differentially-Methylated Regions (DMR) called during the practical (`dmr.rds`) using the provided bsseq object (`bsseqEx.rds`), a) without smoothing b) with smoothing (using `bsseq` smoothing!)
  - Hint: `getMeth(..., regions=...)`
2. Use rGREAT enrichment analysis (from last week's practical) to characterize the DMRs. Phrase your hypothesis for the analysis (what is your enrichment analysis testing exactly?).

Don't forget to render your markdown and push it as `assignment.html` in the appropriate folder!
