# Week 2

The assignment for this week:

1. Using `AnnotationHub`, find and download the following annotations data:
 - The mouse (Mus Musculus) EnsDb object, version 102, genome build GRCm38
 - The mouse genome sequence ( dna_sm ) in TwoBit/2bit format for GRCm38
 - The drosophila melanogaster genome sequence ( dna_sm ) in TwoBit/2bit format for BDGP6

2. Using the mouse EnsDb object, find the following:
 - How many different ensembl gene IDs and gene symbols are there for protein-coding genes?
 - Plot the distribution (histogram) of how many exons protein-coding genes
 - Plot the distribution of the (spliced) length of protein-coding transcripts

Name your markdown file `assignment.Rmd`, put it (along with the produced html) 
in the `week02` folder of your repository, and push!
