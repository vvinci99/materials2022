# Week 7

## Assignment

In the same dataset of ATAC on chr19, plot the profile of insertions (i.e. 'cuts') for, respectively, nucleosome-free and nucleosome-containing fragments, around the high-confidence motifs of two factors.

You can choose your own factors of interest, or for instance use REST and the glucocorticoid receptor (search “GCR”).

### Expected form of the answer:

2 figures (one for each factor), each containing the heatmaps of the two signals around the motifs
